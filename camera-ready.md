### Finalize authors and paper title
Before you prepare for the final (camera-ready) version, please finalise the authors and paper title through hotcrp. The deadline for submitting the camera-ready version of your paper is November 1st.

### Rights management form
* Before submitting camera-ready papers, you need to complete the rights management form. You will be notified by email once these forms are available and ready to sign.

* As rights management emails are sent from an automated system, there is a chance that emails sent will wind up in SPAM folders. Please make sure that you and your authors set email SPAM settings to allow emails from rightsreview@acm.org.

* Once you complete the rights management form, you will receive the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip to place within your paper. It is essential that you add the text into your paper.


### Revise the paper
* You must revise the original submission to address the reviewers' concerns.

### Format paper
* Work-in-progress research results should be no more than 6 pages (excl. references) and position papers should be no more than 2 pages (excl. references). 
* All single-spaced pages for text and figures, 9pt.
* ACM templates can be found here: <http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>. In TeX, you should use `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.
* Note, the font size in the submission template was 10pt, the new template will use 9pt. Using the new ACM template means that you have more space, to address the comments by the reviewers and shepherds.
* Please do NOT number the pages of your camera-ready paper (by default page numbers are disabled in the ACM template).
* You should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on ACM CCS website.
* After completing ACM rights management form, you will be emailed the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip to place within your paper. It is essential that you add the text into your paper. Make use of the following TeX macros:
  * ```\acmYear{2021}```
  * ```\copyrightyear{2021}```
  * ```\setcopyright{acmcopyright}```
  * ```\acmConference{DistributedML '21}{December 7, 2021}{Virtual Event, * Germany}```
  * ```\acmPrice{TBA}``` % Use the data from your email from ACM rights management
  * ```\acmDOI{TBA}``` % Use the data from your email from ACM rights management
  * ```\acmISBN{TBA}``` % Use the data from your email from ACM rights management
* Inclusion of running headers is a requirement. Please shorten the headers if title or list of authors is too long, such as:
  * ```\title[Short title]{Looooong title...}```
  * ```\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{First author et al.}```
* Avoid using any special characters or non-standard fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, thus you must embed all fonts in the PDF file. This is an ACM requirement.
 
### Submit camera-ready version
* Upload the references, source files, and PDF of your camera-ready paper to <https://iwci21.hotcrp.com/>
* Submitting the references and source files is an ACM requirement.
* Submit auxiliary material if applicable.
* The deadline is November 1st.
